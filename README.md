The Pitch

Restaurant owners struggle with all the high tech services that they need to run their businesses. You have countless POS(point-of-sales) systems, the credit card processing jaugernauts, scheduling software. Least of all all the website options that they just can't understand how to make it work.

This product is an all in one solution for busy restaurant owners. This website has the ability to take reservations. Reservations cost $2 dollars every time they are made from Resy. It's a big expense for business owners. This is going to solve that problem for you. 

Scheduling, the bane of manager's existence. People call out, they forget their schedules, they get sick. Missing workers costs businesses money by lowering standard of output.

Updating a physical menu is a pain let alone getting in contact with your website provider to update your website. By the time they get to updating the website your menu will change again. With this tool you will fill out a form in your personalized page where you upload a picture, give a description and a price and they software will handle the rest.

Most people pick which restaurant they are going to pick by either going on their phone or their computers. With elegant design and robust functionality this software will not just save you money but also increase the standard of service you can provide for your customers.
